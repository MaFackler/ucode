# UCode

Vim like code editor

# Build

Windows: make sure vcvarsall.bat is %PATH% available and execute the misc/shell.bat.
The best way to set the development environment is to start the "devshell" with

```
cmd.exe /k <...>\misc\shell.bat
```
Then the program can be build with:

```
build
```

# Run the program

```
run
```
or

```
build\ucode.exe
```
